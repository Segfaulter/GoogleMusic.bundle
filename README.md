GoogleMusic.bundle
==================

A Plex plugin for Google Music. An All Access account is not required but many of the features will not work without one.

Special thanks to pablorusso for making this work for stations. I've compiled the pycryptodomex 3.4.2 library for Mac Plex Clients

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
1.  Copy GoogleMusic.bundle to your plugin directory
    * Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins
2.  Make sure to add your username and password in the plugin settings
